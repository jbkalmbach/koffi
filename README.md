Known Objects From Fits Indices

A package that should hopefully be helpful to people working with stack-and-shift alogorithms and other solar system science use cases. Given an input of possible solar system objects (PotentialSources) relating either to an x and y coordinate of a FITS image or a ra dec coordinate with a timestamp, we provide an easy API for converting x and y coordinates into ra and dec and querying the most well known solar system dynamics api services, the IMCCE's SkyBoT VO tool and JPLâ€™s SSD (Solar System Dynamics) API service.

This package is based off of code developed by Jeremy Kubica for the [KBMOD](https://github.com/dirac-institute/kbmod) package.
